# Dark Mode Feature – Process Reflection

## What I Built
For this Micro-Iteration project, I decided to build a drak mode toggle button for my mechanic website from the Week 3 project.

## Micro-Iteration Experience
Working in small steps did provide a sense of control, however I found the overall process very frustrating and not something that I would choose to use again. It felt much slower and at times like a huge waste of my time. Add one small adjustment, such as implementing a toggle button took significantly longer than it normally would, if I would have just coded it myself. While ther may be some use and benefits for micro-iteration it feels unnecessary for students like us to be using in projects like these

Using the Claude Code Web browser tool was extremely slow. It took a long time to process what I asked it to do, process and analyze files, before generating a response

## Self-Review Patterns
The self review process was beneficial. Claude code did a good job reviewing the code and identifying potential error or issues that could have caused problems later, such as missing elements.

## Browser Tool vs CLI
The browser tool itself was very slow and difficult to manage. It was harder to keep track of sessions when getting started with setup and ensuring that it stayed in planning and review rather than automatically applying changes to my code. The interface displayed a large amount of information, and I often had to resize my screen just to capture everything in one screenshot.


## When I Would Use This Workflow
If it were up to me, I would not choose to work with this workflow again. There was also no tutorial on how to setup and do this assignment until nearly end of day, which made the process even more challenging. The user interface is confusing, especially with the large shortcut section offering three different workflow options. It took me some time to understand how to disable automatic code changes. After doing some research while waiting for responses, I found that many users describe this interface as slow and not worth the extra effort.
