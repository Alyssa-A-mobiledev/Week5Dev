# Dark Mode Feature Plan
1. Create Toggle Button and decide where it will be located and then add that element to the page. I decided it should be added to the Navbar

2. Decide the CSS for the Dark mode. Need to define in the style sheet what the alternative colors will be, and make sure the page still looks good in dark mode

3. Write the coding script for the toggle button, so that toggle affects the class on the <body> once the button is clicked. Test to make sure that changes actually happen

4. Add something that saves the users preferences. ensuring that on page load the changes are set accordingly

5. Make sure that the Dark mode toggle is synchronizing across all the pages. Make sure to refresh between the pages to make sure the chnages confirmed persist

6. Refine the UX by adding a transition effect for a smoother change from the standard website to the dark mode

7. Do final Testing, click through every page to make sure that there is no styling inconsistency
