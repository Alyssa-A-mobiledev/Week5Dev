          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Leslie Auto Repair started with a simple idea: treat every customer the way you'd want to be treated. Back
            in the late 1980s, Leslie saw too many shops cutting corners, overcharging for parts, and leaving customers
            confused about what was actually wrong with their vehicles. He knew there had to be a better way.</p>
          <p>With a toolbox, years of hands-on experience, and a commitment to doing things right, Leslie opened the
            doors to his own shop in Sunrise, Florida. Word spread quickly. Neighbors told neighbors. One satisfied
            customer became ten, then a hundred, then thousands.</p>
          <p>Today, more than 25 years later, that same commitment drives everything we do.</p>
